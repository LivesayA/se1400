        <h1>Andrew Livesay Resume Website</h1>
        <p>My final project will be designing a website to act as a resume for myself.</p>

        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>

        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>The site will mostly contain information about myself in order to be shown as a resume for potential
            employers in the future.</p>

        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
        <p>More than likely it will be from royalty free websites or self-generated
            imagery that I can use in a resume to a future employer.</p>

        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>Because the focus of the site is more for my personal use in getting a job and reflecting myself
            as a person and may hold little or no interest to the person viewing it.</p>

        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>While a standard resume is perfectly fine,
            creating your own website using html that is customized is impressive, especially if the UI is clean or well
            thought out.</p>

        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>I would like users to look at the site, view code and other things about me to get a good idea of my
            abilities and skills,
            and come to the decision to hire me.</p>

        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
        <p>The goal of the site is to both polish my skills in html and
            create a living website that I can consistently update as I go through my career.</p>
