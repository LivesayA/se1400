        <h2>The Positive Aspects of Resume Sites Analyzed:</h2>
        <h4>Good Use of Colors:</h4>
        <p>Many sites I noticed used a good variety of colors in order to differentiate themselves as I've done here, though I'm sad to say I don't think I got a good combination.</p>
        <h4>Direct Messaging:</h4>
        <p>Many of the sites I visited and researched were direct and straight to the point about why they existed, giving the visitor information as fast as possible.</p>
        <h4>Advanced Features:</h4>
        <p>Many sites I visited had features and presentation that mimic the functionality of more advanced websites for more mainstream companies and services.</p>

        <h2>The Negative Aspects of Resume Sites Visited:</h2>
        <h4>Sparce/Lots of Empty Space:</h4>
        <p>A lot of these resume websites are very sparce and don't have any personal touches from the people using them, some only had a link to a dowload for the actual resume.</p>
        <h4>Poor Utilisation of Websites:</h4>
        <p>Many of the resume sites don't even use their medium to their advantage and instead use stock assets from sites like SquareSpace or google sites, it's used more like an advertizing space rather than an actual site.</p>

        <h2>Improvements I Can Make:</h2>
        <h4>Advanced Linking:</h4>
        <p>Using the website medium to actively show my ability to create websites and my knowledge of code and design for websites to display my skills.</p>
        <h4>Fully Utilise Space:</h4>
        <p>Where many people simply use the medium of websites to be more of an advertisement, I can instead use it to create a positive impression of myself by creating an impressive site.</p>
